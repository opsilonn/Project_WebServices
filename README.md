### Where to find the project
Here is the Github repository :
https://github.com/opsilonn/Project_WebServices


### The structure of the project
The project consists of a multitude of folders, most notably :
* SQL scripts - files used to create and fill the Database (more on that later)
* Project_Web_Services.REST : Back-End side of the project, its main core
* Project_Web_Services.CLIENT : Front-End side of the project, the website if you will

Please note that we focused more on having all services available instead of having a proper interface.
This is why you can perform 100% of the requirements with POSTMAN, but only some of them are available and fully implemented on the front website.



## Getting Started
The programmation is fully completed, but we have a small requirement : creating the database.
Don't worry ! We got you covered.


```
You'll need to create an SQL database.
Here are the file to help you create & fill the database :
Creating the Database : Project_WebServices\SQL scripts\databaseCreation.sql
Filling the Database : Project_WebServices\SQL scripts\databaseFill.sql

You'll need to open phpMyAdmin (and, notably, also open Wamp / Wamp / whatever you use).
Import the databaseCreation.sql FIRST, then the databaseFill.sql

Nice, we are now ready to go !
```

Another element is that you can test the REST api :
- with the website (no installation required), but not everything is implemented
- with POSTMAN, but you'll need to use the following Authorization : Basic Auth; Username = test_username; Password = test_password
