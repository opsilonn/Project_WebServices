# Project_WebServices
The aim of the REST project is to provide a group of people (community) with a web page that would allow them to post a set of media items they own such as: books, video games, DVDs, etc. The idea is that the owner could post comments on its items and so do the other users of the website. This could be used as a recommendation page. People before buying or reading a book for instance, would first read the comments and why not ask if the user could land it to them or sell it.
